  <h2>Unit 1.4: Form of Government</h2>
  <p>
    Namibia is a **sovereign democratic republic** with a **multi-party system**, established after its independence from South African administration on **21 March 1990**.
  </p>

  <p>
    The country follows a **constitutional democracy**, where the **President of Namibia** serves as both **Head of State** and **Head of Government**. The executive power is vested in the President, who is elected by direct popular vote for a **five-year term**, renewable once.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Namibian government is structured into **three branches**:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Executive:</strong> Led by the President, who appoints a Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers to oversee various departments.</li>
      <li><strong>Legislative:</strong> Consists of the <strong>National Assembly</strong> (lower house) and the <strong>National Council</strong> (upper house). These bodies are responsible for debating and passing laws.</li>
      <li><strong>Judiciary:</strong> Independent courts, headed by the Supreme Court, interpret and apply laws in accordance with the Constitution.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Namibia's Constitution is considered one of the most progressive in Africa, guaranteeing **fundamental human rights**, **freedom of speech**, **gender equality**, and **protection of the environment**.
  </p>

  <p>
    General elections take place every five years. Citizens elect:
    <ul>
      <li>The President</li>
      <li>Members of the National Assembly</li>
      <li>Regional Councils and Local Authorities</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Namibia is a member of international organisations such as the **United Nations (UN)**, the **African Union (AU)**, and the **Southern African Development Community (SADC)**, promoting peace, development, and regional integration.
  </p>

  <h4>Exam Tip:</h4>
  <p>
    For exam purposes, remember that Namibia is a **democratic republic** with a **multi-party system** and an **executive president**. You may be asked to name the **three branches of government**, explain how leaders are elected, or identify the roles of the **National Assembly** and **National Council**. Also, be familiar with **election frequency**, **key democratic values**, and Namibia’s **constitutional guarantees** such as **freedom, equality, and justice**.

  <h2>Unit 1.6: Climate Conditions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tropic of Capricorn:</strong>
      The <em>Tropic of Capricorn</em> passes through the central region of Namibia, influencing its hot and arid climate. Namibia lies mostly within the subtropical high-pressure belt, which results in predominantly dry weather conditions.
    </li>

    <li><strong>General Climate:</strong>
      Namibia has a combination of <strong>desert, semi-desert, and savanna</strong> climates. It experiences <strong>low and unpredictable rainfall</strong>, intense sunshine (over <strong>300 sunny days per year</strong>), and wide temperature ranges between day and night.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Rainfall:</strong>
      The rainy season occurs mainly between <strong>November and April</strong>. However, rainfall varies across the country:
      <ul>
        <li>North and northeast regions (e.g., Caprivi/Zambezi) receive the most rainfall (up to 600 mm annually).</li>
        <li>Southern and western parts (e.g., Namib Desert) receive the least (as low as 25 mm annually).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Summer (October – April):</strong> Hot and sometimes humid in the north; temperatures can exceed 35°C in desert areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Winter (May – September):</strong> Dry and cool; daytime temperatures are pleasant (18–25°C), but nights can drop below freezing in inland regions.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Desert Influence:</strong>
      The <strong>Namib Desert</strong> on the western coast creates cool mornings and fog due to the cold Benguela Current, while the <strong>Kalahari Desert</strong> in the east causes dry inland conditions.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Best Time to Visit:</strong>
      The ideal time to travel to Namibia is during the <strongdry season (May to October)</strong>. During this period, there is:
      <ul>

    <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Agriculture plays a vital role in rural employment. Due to arid and semi-arid conditions, <strong>livestock farming</strong> dominates, especially cattle, sheep, and goats. <strong>Crop production</strong> is limited to areas with irrigation in the northern regions such as Kavango and Zambezi.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>2. Secondary Economic Sector:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Includes **manufacturing** of meat products, fish processing, textiles, and construction materials. The sector is smaller but growing steadily through industrial development zones and value-added production.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>3. Tertiary Economic Sector:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tourism:</strong> A major source of foreign exchange and employment. Tourists visit attractions such as <strong>Etosha National Park</strong>, <strong>Sossusvlei</strong>, <strong>Fish River Canyon</strong>, and the <strong>Skeleton Coast</strong>. Namibia is known for eco-tourism and wildlife safaris.</li>
    <li><strong>Transport and Trade:</strong> Namibia serves as a transport hub for surrounding landlocked countries (Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe). The Walvis Bay Corridor connects Namibia to regional and international trade routes.</li>
    <li><strong>Banking and Services:</strong> A growing services sector supports financial services, education, healthcare, and public administration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Exam Tip:</h4>
  <p>
    You may be asked to explain the contribution of different sectors of the economy to Namibia’s development.
