    <h2>Unit 1: Passports</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Definition of Passports (IATA)</h3>
    <p>According to IATA, a passport is an official travel document issued by a government that certifies the holder‚Äôs identity and nationality. It is required for international travel and includes the traveller‚Äôs name, photo, date of birth, and signature.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Documents That Could Be Used in Lieu of a Passport</h3>
    <p>In specific cases, alternative documents may be accepted for travel, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emergency Travel Certificate (ETC) ‚Äì issued by South African missions abroad if a passport is lost or stolen.</li>
      <li>Temporary Passport ‚Äì used for urgent travel within the SADC region when regular passports are unavailable.</li>
      <li>National ID Cards ‚Äì accepted in some regional travel zones (e.g., within the EU or SADC in the future).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Conditions for Issuing a Joint Passport</h3>
    <p>A joint passport is a document where a parent/guardian and one or more minor children are included in the same passport. It is now largely phased out in favour of individual passports for each traveller. Joint passports may still be used in some older documents but are no longer issued in South Africa.</p>

    <h3>1.4 How and Where to Obtain Passports</h3>
    <p>South African passports are issued by the Department of Home Affairs. Applicants must submit the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Completed passport application form (DHA-73)</li>
      <li>Valid South African ID</li>
      <li>Two colour passport photos (depending on office requirements)</li>
      <li>Proof of payment of application fee</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Applications can be submitted at a Home Affairs branch or via online booking with selected banks offering eHomeAffairs services.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Validity of South African Passports</h3>
    <p>The validity of passports depends on the type:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Regular passport:</strong> Valid for 10 years (adults)</li>
      <li><strong>Child passport:</strong> Valid for 5 years</li>
      <li><strong>Temporary passport:</strong> Valid for limited periods (usually up to 12 months)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is recommended that a passport has at least 6 months‚Äô validity when travelling internationally.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem; color:#006688;">üìò Exam Tip</h3>
    <p>
      Be able to define a passport and list all acceptable travel documents. Understand the <strong>application process</strong>, including required forms and payment. Know

     <section>
  <h2>Unit 2: Visas</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Definition of Visas and Transit Visas (IATA)</h3>
  <p>
    A <strong>visa</strong> is an official endorsement or stamp placed in a traveller's passport by the immigration authorities of a country, granting permission to enter, stay, or transit through that country for a specified period and purpose. Visas can be issued for tourism, business, study, work, or transit purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <strong>transit visa</strong> is a special visa granted to travellers who pass through a country en route to another destination. It usually allows short stays (from a few hours up to several days) in the transit area or within the country, depending on the immigration laws.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Visa Requirements, Validity, and Where to Obtain Visas</h3>
  <p>
    Visa requirements vary depending on the traveller‚Äôs nationality, the destination country, and the purpose of the visit. Some countries allow <em>visa-free travel</em> or visa-on-arrival for certain nationals.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To obtain a visa, travellers generally need to apply at the embassy or consulate of the destination country, providing documents such as a valid passport, completed visa application forms, photographs, proof of travel arrangements, financial means, and sometimes a letter of invitation.</li>
    <li>Visas have specific validity periods, which define how long the holder can stay in the country. Some visas are single-entry, allowing one entry only, while others may be multiple-entry, permitting several entries during the validity period.</li>
    <li>Electronic visas (e-visas) and online applications are increasingly common and can be obtained via official government websites.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem; color:#006688;">üìò Exam Tip</h3>
  <p>
    Understand the difference between a <strong>visa</strong> and a <strong>transit visa</strong>, including their purposes and limitations. Be familiar with common visa requirements and the application process. Exams may test your ability to identify when a visa is required or to distinguish between types of visas based on scenarios.
  </p>

     <section>
  <h2>Unit 3: Permits</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Regulations Published in the Government Gazette of South Africa (GSA)</h3>
  <p>
    The regulations concerning permits for specific items when travelling are published officially in the <strong>Government Gazette of South Africa (GSA)</strong>. These regulations specify which goods require permits for export, import, or transit through South Africa and other countries. 
    Items such as firearms, antiques, cultural artefacts, certain plants and animals, and restricted medicines must have appropriate permits in accordance with national and international laws.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2 Advising Prospective Tourists on Permits for Specific Items When Entering Foreign Countries</h3>
  <p>
    Travel consultants must inform prospective tourists about the need for permits when carrying specific items into foreign countries. These may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Firearms and ammunition, which require import/export permits and must comply with strict regulations.</li>
    <li>Protected wildlife, plants, or animal products that may require CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) permits.</li>
    <li>High-value electronic equipment or professional gear that may require temporary import permits.</li>
    <li>Certain medicines or controlled substances that require medical prescriptions and permits.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Advising clients properly helps avoid confiscation of items at customs and ensures compliance with international travel laws.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem; color:#006688;">üìò Exam Tip</h3>
  <p>
    Be familiar with the types of items that require permits and the legal sources where these regulations are published (such as the GSA). 
    Understand the role of travel consultants in advising clients about permits, especially for restricted or controlled goods. Exam questions may include identifying items requiring permits or explaining the consequences of non-compliance.

  <h2>Unit 4: Health Documents</h2>

  <h3>4.1 Organisation Responsible for Standardisation of International Health Certificates</h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> is the international body responsible for the standardisation and regulation of health certificates used in international travel. WHO sets the guidelines and formats for health certificates and vaccination records to ensure consistency and global recognition.
  </p>

  <h3>4.2 Certificate Requirements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>4.2.1 International Health Certificates:</strong> These documents certify the health status of a traveller, often required when entering countries with specific health risks. They include information on vaccination history, recent medical examinations, and any relevant health conditions.</li>

    <li><strong>4.2.2 Certificates of Vaccination:</strong> Also known as <em>‚ÄúYellow Cards‚Äù</em> or the <em>International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP)</em>, this certificate records vaccinations such as yellow fever, polio, and meningitis, which may be mandatory for entry into some countries.</li>

    <li><strong>4.2.3 Validity of Certificates of Vaccination:</strong> The validity period varies depending on the vaccine. For example, yellow fever certificates are valid for 10 years from the date of vaccination. It is essential that travellers ensure their certificates are current and meet destination country requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4.3 Interpreting Information from Countries Requiring Vaccination</h3>
  <p>
    Travel consultants must understand the vaccination requirements of destination countries, including which vaccinations are compulsory or recommended. Some countries require proof of vaccination upon arrival, especially those where diseases such as yellow fever are endemic.
  </p>

  <h3>4.4 Regulations Regarding the Validity of Vaccinations</h3>
  <p>
    Vaccinations must be administered by authorized medical personnel and documented properly. Vaccines administered outside the validity period may not be accepted, potentially leading to quarantine or denial of entry. It is the traveller‚Äôs responsibility to keep vaccination records updated.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem; color:#006688;">üìò Exam Tip</h3>
  <p>
    Students should know the role of WHO in health certificate standardisation and be able to identify the types of health documents required for international travel. Be clear on the validity periods of common vaccination certificates and how to interpret country-specific vaccination requirements. Exam questions often include case studies where students must advise travellers on health documentation.

<section>
  <h2>Unit 5: Documentation</h2>

  <h3>5.1 Forms to be Used for Passports, Visas, and Permits According to Their Codes</h3>
  <p>
    Various official forms are used in the application and processing of passports, visas, and permits. These forms are coded for easy identification and reference:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>5.1.1 Passport Application Forms:</strong> In South Africa, the most common form is the <em>DHA-73</em>, which is used to apply for a new passport or renew an existing one. It includes sections for personal details, citizenship status, and emergency contacts.</li>
    <li><strong>Visa Application Forms:</strong> These vary depending on the country of destination, but typically require personal information, travel itinerary, purpose of visit, and proof of financial means.</li>
    <li><strong>Permit Application Forms:</strong> Specific forms are used for permits such as import/export of restricted goods, firearms, or special travel-related permits, each with their own codes and requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5.2 Application Forms for Passports and Visas</h3>
  <p>
    Completing application forms accurately is crucial. Application forms generally request the following information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Full name as per identity document</li>
    <li>Date and place of birth</li>
    <li>Nationality and citizenship details</li>
    <li>Contact information and address</li>
    <li>Purpose of travel and duration</li>
    <li>Payment details and declarations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Below is an example of a typical passport application form layout showing the required fields (this can be shown as a table or image in learning materials):
  </p>
  <div style="overflow-x:auto; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  <table style="width:100%; max-width:700px; margin:auto; border-collapse:collapse; background:#fff; box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border-radius: 10px; overflow:hidden;">
    <thead style="background-color:#004466; color:#fff;">
      <tr>
        <th style="padding:12px; text-align:left;">Section</th>
        <th style="padding:12px; text-align:left;">Details Required</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;">
        <td style="padding:10px;">Personal Details</td>
        <td style="padding:10px;">Name, Date of Birth, Place of Birth</td>
      </tr>
      <tr style="background:#f1f7fb; border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;">
        <td style="padding:10px;">Contact Details</td>
        <td style="padding:10px;">Address, Phone Number, Email</td>
      </tr>
      <tr style="border-bottom:1px solid #ddd;">
        <td style="padding:10px;">Travel Information</td>
        <td style="padding:10px;">Purpose of Travel, Destination</td>
      </tr>
      <tr style="background:#f1f7fb;">
        <td style="padding:10px;">Payment Details</td>
        <td style="padding:10px;">Method of Payment, Receipt Number</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

  <h3>5.3 Identifying Errors on Completed Forms</h3>
  <p>
    Common errors include incomplete sections, incorrect dates, mismatched names, illegible handwriting, missing signatures, or failure to attach required documents. Travel consultants must carefully review forms to avoid delays or rejection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ensuring accuracy prevents processing issues and assists travellers in obtaining their travel documents on time.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem; color:#006688;">üìò Exam Tip</h3>
  <p>
    Be able to identify the correct forms used for passports, visas, and permits, and know the key sections within application forms. Practice spotting common mistakes on sample forms, as exam questions may require you to correct or highlight errors.
