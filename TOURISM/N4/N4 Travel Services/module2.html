  <h2>Unit 3: Baggage Requirements</h2>

  <h3>3.1 IATA Definitions and Terminology</h3>
  <p><strong>Define the following:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>3.1.1 Baggage:</strong> All items and belongings carried by a passenger while travelling. It includes both checked-in and carry-on items.</li>

    <li><strong>3.1.2 Checked Baggage:</strong> Baggage handed over at check-in to be stored in the aircraft's cargo hold. It is tagged and retrieved at the destination.</li>

    <li><strong>3.1.3 Unchecked Baggage (Carry-on Items):</strong> Also called hand luggage, these are items passengers take into the cabin. Size and weight are strictly limited for security and safety reasons.</li>

    <li><strong>3.1.4 Free Baggage Allowance:</strong> The amount of baggage (by weight or number of pieces) that passengers can carry without paying additional fees, determined by airline and route.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.2 Weight and Piece Concepts</h3>
  <p>Airlines apply one of two baggage policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Weight Concept:</strong> Baggage is limited by total weight (e.g., 23 kg or 30 kg). Common on international flights (excluding North America).</li>
    <li><strong>Piece Concept:</strong> Passengers are allowed a fixed number of bags (e.g., 2 pieces, each not exceeding 23 kg). Common for travel to/from North America.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.3 Free Baggage Allowance (Weight Concept)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>3.3.1 International Travel:</strong> Most airlines allow 20‚Äì30 kg per economy class passenger. Business class passengers may receive more.</li>

    <li><strong>3.3.2 Domestic Travel:</strong> South African domestic flights typically allow 20 kg in economy class. LCCs (low-cost carriers) may charge separately.</li>

    <li><strong>3.3.3 Exceptions to Normal Baggage:</strong> Infants may be allowed a pram or car seat. Sporting equipment and musical instruments may count as excess baggage.</li>

    <li><strong>3.3.4 Carry-On Items:</strong> Usually limited to one item not exceeding 7‚Äì10 kg, plus one small personal item (e.g., handbag or laptop).</li>

    <li><strong>3.3.5 Items Not Allowed in Checked Baggage:</strong> Fragile items, valuable items (e.g., jewelry, electronics), cash, medicine, and documents must be carried as hand luggage.</li>

    <li><strong>3.3.6 Dangerous Goods:</strong> Items such as explosives, flammable liquids, gases, toxic substances, and corrosives are prohibited. Refer to ICAO and IATA lists for classification.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.4 Free Baggage Allowance (Piece Concept)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>3.4.1 Restrictions on Number of Pieces and Dimensions:</strong> Typically, each piece must not exceed 23 kg and total dimensions (length + width + height) must not exceed 158 cm.</li>

    <li><strong>3.4.2 Children and Infants:</strong> Infants not occupying a seat are usually allowed 1 piece of baggage and 1 stroller or car seat free of charge.</li>

    <li><strong>3.4.3 Special Articles:</strong> Items like sports gear or musical instruments may be accepted but require prior arrangements and may incur additional charges.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.5 Baggage Shipped as Cargo</h3>
  <p>Baggage exceeding size/weight limits or shipped separately must be declared and transported as cargo. Cargo shipments require special documentation and fees.</p>

  <h3>3.6 Items, Weight, Size, and Number of Baggage Allowed</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>3.6.1 Carry-On Baggage (Cabin):</strong> Typically 1 bag per passenger, 7‚Äì10 kg, with size not exceeding 56 x 36 x 23 cm.</li>

    <li><strong>3.6.2 Checked Baggage:</strong> Weight allowance usually ranges from 20‚Äì32 kg depending on class and airline. Size is limited to 158 cm in total dimensions.</li>

    <li><strong>3.6.3 Items Carried as Cargo Only:</strong> Oversized, hazardous, or live animals are transported in the cargo hold under specific airline policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.7 Rules on Pooling Baggage</h3>
  <p>Pooling refers to combining baggage allowances between passengers. Some airlines allow pooling for passengers on the same reservation; others do not. Always check airline policies beforehand.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem; color:#006688;">üìò Exam Tip</h3>
  <p>
    Learn the <strong>difference between weight and piece concepts</strong>, especially the regions where they apply. Memorize allowances for domestic vs. international travel. 
    Review IATA baggage definitions and know examples of <strong>restricted or dangerous goods</strong>. This section often appears as multiple-choice, match-the-columns, or short-answer questions.

  <h2>Unit 4: Check-In Procedures</h2>

  <h3>4.1 Minimum Reporting Times</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>4.1.1 Domestic Flights:</strong> Passengers are advised to arrive at the airport at least <strong>90 minutes</strong> before the scheduled departure time. Check-in counters generally close 30‚Äì45 minutes before departure, depending on the airline.</li>

    <li><strong>4.1.2 International Flights:</strong> Passengers should report to the airport at least <strong>3 hours</strong> prior to departure. This allows enough time for check-in, security checks, passport control, and boarding.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4.2 Check-In for Onward and Return Journeys Simultaneously</h3>
  <p>Many airlines allow passengers to check in for both <strong>onward and return flights</strong> if they are operated by the same airline or partner carriers. This helps reduce delays and waiting time at transit or return check-in counters. E-tickets and itinerary details must be presented at the initial check-in counter.</p>

  <h3>4.3 Correct Sequence When Advising a Passenger About Check-In Procedures</h3>
  <p>When advising a client about the check-in process, travel consultants must follow this sequence:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Advise the minimum reporting time based on flight type (domestic or international).</li>
    <li>Inform the passenger to bring all necessary travel documents (passport, visa, ticket/booking confirmation, and ID).</li>
    <li>Explain baggage allowance rules (including weight, number of items, and restrictions).</li>
    <li>Advise on special services if needed (e.g., wheelchair, unaccompanied minors).</li>
    <li>Notify the passenger to proceed to the airline‚Äôs check-in desk or self-service kiosk on arrival.</li>
    <li>Remind them to collect a boarding pass and proceed through security well in advance.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem; color:#006688;">üìò Exam Tip</h3>
  <p>
    Know the <strong>exact reporting times</strong> for both domestic and international flights. Be able to explain the <strong>steps of the check-in process</strong> in the correct sequence. 
    Common exam questions ask students to complete missing steps or place steps in logical order. Review the differences between check-in at the airport and online check-in options.

  <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem; color:#006688;">üìò Exam Tip</h3>
  <p>
    Learn the <strong>duty-free limits</strong> and what qualifies for a <strong>flat-rate assessment</strong>. Know the difference between the <strong>green and red channels</strong>. Understand what must be <strong>declared or registered</strong>. Common exam questions include matching items with procedures and identifying when a permit is required.

  <h2>Module 2 Summary: Passenger Services</h2>
  <p>
    This module introduces students to the key services and procedures involved in passenger handling within the travel and tourism industry. 
    It begins with an overview of airport facilities, distinguishing between international and domestic services, business and economy class, 
    and special services for passengers with disabilities. The module also explores important baggage regulations including definitions, 
    allowance concepts (weight and piece), prohibited items, and the rules for shipping baggage as cargo. Students are taught the correct 
    procedures for check-in, including minimum reporting times, onward and return journey check-ins, and how to advise clients. Customs regulations 
    are also covered in detail‚Äîfocusing on duty-free allowances, declaration procedures, and special permits for items. Finally, the module explains 
    the handling of transiting passengers and the facilities and support provided for travellers with special needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    A strong understanding of passenger services helps students provide accurate advice to clients, comply with legal requirements, 
    and enhance the overall travel experience for passengers. For exams, students must be able to compare domestic vs. international 
    procedures, understand baggage and customs rules, and demonstrate the correct sequence of passenger check-in and support services. 
    Real-life scenarios and definitions are often tested through multiple-choice, matching, and case-study questions.
