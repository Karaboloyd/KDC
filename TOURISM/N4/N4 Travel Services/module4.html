    <li><strong>1.1 Code and Decode Cities, Airports, and Airlines</strong></li>
    <p>
      The International Air Transport Association (IATA) assigns unique three-letter codes to cities and airports worldwide to simplify communication and reservation systems in the travel industry. Similarly, airlines have unique two-character codes used for identification in booking and ticketing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of important IATA codes include:

  </div>



  
  <p><strong>4.1 Calculating and Quoting Fares</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>4.1.1 Domestic Flights and Journeys:</strong>  
      For domestic travel within South Africa, fares are generally calculated based on distance and a fixed rate per kilometer. Additional costs include VAT, airport taxes, and sometimes service fees. Students should understand how to:
      <ul>
        <li>Identify fare zones or distance brackets</li>
        <li>Apply correct rates per kilometer (e.g., R1.50/km)</li>
        <li>Calculate total cost: <code>Total Fare = Base Fare + VAT + Tax</code></li>
      </ul>
      Example: A flight from Johannesburg to Durban (600 km) at R1.50/km = R900 base fare + 15% VAT = R1,035 total.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>4.1.2 Regional Flights and Journeys:</strong>  
      These involve travel between South Africa and neighboring countries (e.g., Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe). Calculations follow similar methods but may include:
      <ul>
        <li>International departure tax</li>
        <li>Currency exchange rate impacts</li>
        <li>Possible interline agreements for connecting flights</li>
      </ul>
      Example: Johannesburg to Gaborone (Botswana) flight ‚Äì 300 km √ó R1.80/km + international tax (R200) + fuel surcharge.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>4.2 Recommending a Fare and/or Booking Class Based on a Fare Table, the Rules, and a Client Profile:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Travel consultants must analyze fare tables to recommend the most suitable booking class (e.g., Economy, Business, First) and fare type (refundable, non-refundable, flexible). Factors include:
    <ul>
      <li>Travel dates and times</li>
      <li>Flexibility of the passenger</li>
      <li>Advance booking requirements</li>
      <li>Stopovers or connections</li>
    </ul>
    Using this information, the consultant can balance affordability and flexibility to meet the client‚Äôs needs.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#006688;">üìò Exam Tip</h3>
  <p>
    Practice calculating fares using both distance and rate charts. Know how to apply VAT and taxes correctly. Be prepared to read fare tables and offer advice on booking classes based on a client profile. Expect exam questions that involve both fare calculation and client scenario analysis.

  <h2>Unit 5: General Rules on Reservations</h2>

  <p><strong>5.1 IATA Recommendations in the Code of Reservation Ethics</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>5.1.1 Booking Space:</strong>  
      Travel agents must ensure that bookings made are genuine and based on a client‚Äôs confirmed intent to travel. Agents must avoid making duplicate or speculative bookings that may block availability for other travelers. Accurate passenger details and itinerary must be recorded at the time of booking.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>5.1.2 Cancelling Space:</strong>  
      When a passenger cancels or changes their travel plans, the agent is responsible for immediately cancelling the reservation to free the seat for other passengers. Delayed cancellation may result in penalties or loss of reputation with the airline.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>5.1.3 Responsibility of Travel Agents:</strong>  
      Agents are expected to act ethically by providing correct information, avoiding false reservations, and following standard procedures. They are responsible for keeping clients informed about changes, requirements, and fare conditions.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>5.2 Rule 1‚Äì8 of IATA Resolution 830d (Reservation Procedures):</strong></p>
  <p>
    These are global procedures outlined by IATA for consistent and ethical booking practices. The rules include: using proper names, avoiding dummy bookings, advising clients of ticketing time limits, recording contact details correctly, and ensuring prompt cancellation of unused space. Failure to follow these rules can lead to financial penalties or loss of agency accreditation.
  </p>

  <p><strong>5.3 Applying the Rules and Recommendations:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Travel consultants must apply IATA‚Äôs rules and ethical recommendations in their daily work. They should ensure compliance with airline systems, avoid overbooking, and always communicate clearly with clients. Maintaining professionalism in all bookings helps build client trust and avoids unnecessary complications.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#006688;">üìò Exam Tip</h3>
  <p>
    Memorize key IATA reservation rules and ethical guidelines. Focus on how agents must handle booking, cancellation, and changes. Be able to apply these rules in client-based scenarios. For exams, you may be asked to identify ethical breaches or suggest the correct procedure in a real-world travel booking situation.

  <h2>Unit 6: How to Make a Reservation</h2>

  <p><strong>6.1 Making a Telephone Reservation:</strong></p>
  <p>
    When making a telephone reservation, travel consultants must follow a professional and structured approach:
    <ul>
      <li>Greet the client politely and identify yourself and your agency.</li>
      <li>Gather all necessary travel details: full names (as per ID/passport), destination, travel dates, preferred airline/class, and any special needs (e.g., wheelchair access or meal preferences).</li>
      <li>Repeat the details back to confirm accuracy.</li>
      <li>Confirm availability and provide options for flights, fares, and booking classes.</li>
      <li>Advise the client of ticketing time limits and any applicable conditions (e.g., refund policies, visa requirements).</li>
      <li>Record all booking details clearly and ensure client contact details are captured accurately.</li>
    </ul>
    Communication should be clear, courteous, and efficient.
  </p>

  <p><strong>6.2 Giving a Written Account of a Telephone Reservation:</strong></p>
  <p>
    After making a reservation by phone, it is important to document the conversation in writing. This includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Client‚Äôs name and contact information</li>
      <li>Flight details (airline, flight number, date, time, route)</li>
      <li>Fare quoted and booking class</li>
      <li>Special requests or notes (e.g., seat preference, meal choice)</li>
      <li>Reservation reference number (PNR) and ticketing deadline</li>
    </ul>
    The written summary should be professional, dated, and filed or sent to the client as confirmation.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#006688;">üìò Exam Tip</h3>
  <p>
    Know the full step-by-step process of making a telephone reservation and how to summarise it clearly in writing. You may be asked in exams to write a sample telephone booking log or identify missing information from a booking scenario. Accuracy, clarity, and professionalism are key!

<section>
  <h2>Unit 7: Documentation</h2>

  <p><strong>7.1 Selecting Transport, Accommodation, and Tours, and Completing a Client File</strong></p>
  <p>
    Travel consultants must select appropriate travel services that match the client‚Äôs preferences, needs, and budget. This includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Transport: Choosing air, rail, coach, or car hire based on routes, fares, and travel times.</li>
      <li>Accommodation: Matching client preferences with star rating, location, and amenities.</li>
      <li>Tours: Selecting suitable guided tours or excursions based on interests and available time.</li>
    </ul>
    A completed client file must contain:
    <ul>
      <li>Client‚Äôs personal details (name, ID/passport, contact info)</li>
      <li>Confirmed itinerary (dates, times, and providers)</li>
      <li>Payment and invoicing records</li>
      <li>Travel insurance details (if applicable)</li>
      <li>All required documents ‚Äì vouchers, tickets, confirmations</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p><strong>7.2 Completing Booking Documents</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>7.2.1 Hotel Voucher (Domestic Booking):</strong>  
      A hotel voucher is a document provided to the client and presented at the accommodation. It should include:
      <ul>
        <li>Guest name(s)</li>
        <li>Hotel name, address, and contact number</li>
        <li>Check-in and check-out dates</li>

        <li>Special notes (e.g., early check-in, late checkout)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Booking Files:</strong>  
      A booking file is the central record of all travel arrangements. It must be completed accurately and updated regularly. The file includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Client profile</li>
        <li>Flight and transport bookings</li>
        <li>Accommodation reservations</li>

        <li>Confirmation numbers and payment records</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color:#006688;">üìò Exam Tip</h3>
  <p>
    Be familiar with the structure and content of both a hotel voucher and a full booking file. In exams, you may be asked to complete or correct a client booking document.
