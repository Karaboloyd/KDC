  <h2>Unit 1: The Marketing Concept</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Marketing Defined:</strong> 
      Marketing is the process of identifying, anticipating, and satisfying client needs profitably. Unlike sales, which focus primarily on closing individual deals, marketing aims to build long-term relationships with clients by consistently delivering value and meeting their expectations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Evolution of Marketing:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Production Era:</em> Focus was on mass production and efficiency to meet growing demand.</li>
        <li><em>Sales Era:</em> Emphasis shifted to aggressive selling techniques to overcome competition.</li>
        <li><em>Marketing Era:</em> Customer orientation became central; businesses focused on understanding customer needs and creating value through products and services.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>"Services Marketing" vs "Manufacturing Marketing":</strong> 
      The main difference lies in tangibility:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Services Marketing:</strong> Services are intangible, meaning they cannot be seen or touched before purchase. Quality depends largely on the staff’s expertise, customer experience, and reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Manufacturing Marketing:</strong> Products are tangible goods with physical attributes such as design, packaging, and features that customers can evaluate before purchase.</li>
      </ul>
      In the travel industry, service quality and customer experience are especially important.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Be able to explain how marketing differs from sales, describe the key stages in marketing evolution, and compare the characteristics of service marketing versus product marketing. Use examples from the travel industry where possible.</p>

  <h2>Unit 2: Consumer Behaviour</h2>

        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Individual</strong></td>

            <td><strong>Social</strong></td>
            <td>Influenced by culture, family, reference groups, social roles, life-cycle stages, and social class which impact travel habits and choices.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Economic</strong></td>
            <td>Factors such as income levels, disposable income, economic conditions, and willingness to pay influence the affordability and type of travel selected.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>These factors collectively influence consumers’ travel decisions, budgeting, destination preferences, and travel styles.</p>

  <h2>Unit 6: Online Bookings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Booking Procedures:</strong>
      Online bookings are done through Global Distribution Systems (GDS) such as <strong>Amadeus</strong>, <strong>Sabre</strong>, and <strong>Galileo</strong>, as well as Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like <strong>Booking.com</strong>, <strong>Expedia</strong>, and <strong>Travelstart</strong>. The standard booking process involves:
      <ol>
        <li>Checking real-time availability of services (flights, hotels, car hire)</li>
        <li>Providing a price quotation to the client</li>
        <li>Confirming client details and processing payment</li>
        <li>Issuing the e-ticket or travel documents electronically</li>
      </ol>
      Accuracy and timing are critical in this process, especially when dealing with limited seat availability or dynamic pricing.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Advantages and Disadvantages of Online Booking Systems:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> 
          <ul>
            <li>Available 24/7 — bookings can be made at any time</li>
            <li>Quick and easy comparison of prices and travel options</li>
            <li>Access to special promotions and competitive rates</li>
            <li>Immediate confirmation and ticket issuance</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> 
          <ul>
            <li>Lack of personal interaction and tailored service</li>
            <li>Lower brand or agency loyalty among clients</li>
            <li>Risk of booking errors due to user input or system issues</li>
            <li>Online security concerns (credit card fraud, data breaches)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Phonetic Alphabet:</strong>
      Used during online or phone bookings to avoid confusion when confirming names, reference numbers, or ticket codes. Each letter is represented by a word for clarity:
      <br><br>
      <strong>Example:</strong> A = Alpha, B = Bravo, C = Charlie, D = Delta, E = Echo, F = Foxtrot, G = Golf, H = Hotel, I = India, J = Juliett, K = Kilo, L = Lima, M = Mike, N = November, O = Oscar, P = Papa, Q = Quebec, R = Romeo, S = Sierra, T = Tango, U = Uniform, V = Victor, W = Whiskey, X = X-ray, Y = Yankee, Z = Zulu
      <br><br>
      This system helps prevent errors when spelling names or codes over the phone or through voice communication.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Know the steps of an online booking process, be able to explain the pros and cons of GDS/OTA platforms, and memorize the full phonetic alphabet — it’s a common exam question!</p>
